        Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
        <br><br>
        A Coverdell education savings account (Coverdell ESA) is a trust or custodial account set up in the
        United States solely for paying qualified education expenses for the designated beneficiary of the
        account. There are certain requirements to set up a Coverdell ESA:
        <br><br>

        When you establish the account, the designated beneficiary must be under the age of 18 or
        be a special needs beneficiary. You may be able to contribute to a Coverdell ESA to finance
        the beneficiary's qualified education expenses. Contributions must be made in cash, and
        they're not deductible. Any individual whose modified adjusted gross income is under the
        limit set for a given tax year can make contributions. Organizations, such as corporations
        and trusts can also contribute regardless of their adjusted gross income. Contributors must
        contribute by the due date of their tax return (not including extensions). There's no limit
        to the number of accounts that can be established for a particular beneficiary; however, the
        total contribution to all accounts on behalf of a beneficiary in any year can't exceed
        $2,000.
        <br><br>
        In general, the designated beneficiary of a Coverdell ESA can receive tax-free distributions
        to pay qualified education expenses. The distributions are tax-free to the extent the amount
        of the distributions doesn't exceed the beneficiary's qualified education expenses. If a
        distribution exceeds the beneficiary's qualified education expenses, a portion of the earnings
        is taxable to the beneficiary. Amounts remaining in the account must be distributed when the
        designated beneficiary reaches age 30, unless the beneficiary is a special needs beneficiary.
        Certain transfers to members of the beneficiary's family are permitted.
        <br><br>
        For information on how to determine the part of any distribution that is taxable earnings, refer
        to Chapter 7 of Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.
        <br><br>
        Introduction
        <br><br>
        If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is less than $110,000 ($220,000 if filing a joint return),
        you may be able to establish a Coverdell ESA to finance the qualified education expenses of a designated
        beneficiary. For most taxpayers, MAGI is the adjusted gross income as figured on their federal income tax
        return.
        <br><br>
        This benefit applies not only to higher education expenses, but also to elementary and secondary education
        expenses.
        <br><br>
        Contributions to a Coverdell ESA aren't deductible, but amounts deposited in the account grow tax free
        until distributed.
        <br><br>
        Qualified Education Expenses
        <br><br>
        Generally, these are expenses required for the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary
        at an eligible educational institution. For purposes of Coverdell ESAs, the expenses can be either
        qualified higher education expenses or qualified elementary and secondary education expenses.
        <br><br>
        Designated beneficiary. This is the individual named in the document creating the trust or custodial
        account to receive the benefit of the funds in the account.
        <br><br>
        Contributions to a qualified tuition program (QTP). A contribution to a QTP is a qualified education
        expense if the contribution is on behalf of the designated beneficiary of the Coverdell ESA. In the case
        of a change in beneficiary, this is a qualified expense only if the new beneficiary is a family member of
        that designated beneficiary.
        <br><br>
        Eligible Educational Institution
        <br>
        For purposes of Coverdell ESAs, an eligible educational institution can be either an eligible
        postsecondary school or an eligible elementary or secondary school.
