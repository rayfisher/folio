        IRA
        <br>
        A traditional IRA is any IRA that is not a Roth IRA or a SIMPLE IRA. The following are two advantages
        of a traditional IRA:
        <br><br>
        <li>You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to it, depending on your circumstances.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Generally, amounts in your IRA, including earnings and gains, are not taxed until they are
            distributed.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?
        <br>
        You can open and make contributions to a traditional IRA if:
        <br><br>
        <li>You (or, if you file a joint return, your spouse) received taxable compensation during the year,
            and
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>You were not age 70½ by the end of the year.</li>
        <br>
        You can have a traditional IRA whether or not you are covered by any other retirement plan. However,
        you may not be able to deduct all of your contributions if you or your spouse is covered by an employer
        retirement plan. See How Much Can You Deduct? , later.
        <br><br>
        Both spouses have compensation. If both you and your spouse have compensation and are under age 70½,
        each of you can open an IRA. You cannot both participate in the same IRA. If you file a joint return,
        only one of you needs to have compensation.
        <br><br>
        What Is Compensation?
        <br><br>
        Generally, compensation is what you earn from working. For a summary of what compensation does and
        does not include, see Table 1-1. Compensation includes all of the items discussed next (even if you
        have more than one type).
        <br><br>
        Wages, salaries, etc. Wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other amounts you
        receive for providing personal services are compensation. The IRS treats as compensation any amount
        properly shown in box 1 (Wages, tips, other compensation) of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement,
        provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11 (Nonqualified plans).
        Scholarship and fellowship payments are compensation for IRA purposes only if shown in box 1 of Form
        W-2.
        <br><br>
        Commissions. An amount you receive that is a percentage of profits or sales price is compensation.
        <br><br>
        Self-employment income. If you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or a partner), compensation is
        the net earnings from your trade or business (provided your personal services are a material
        income-producing factor) reduced by the total of:
        <br><br>
        <li>The deduction for contributions made on your behalf to retirement plans, and</li>
        <li>The deduction allowed for the deductible part of your self-employment taxes.</li>
        <br><br>
        Self-employment loss. If you have a net loss from self-employment, do not subtract the loss from
        your salaries or wages when figuring your total compensation.
        <br><br>
        Alimony and separate maintenance. For IRA purposes, compensation includes any taxable alimony and
        separate maintenance payments you receive under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.
        <br><br>
        Nontaxable combat pay. If you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, compensation includes any
        nontaxable combat pay you received. This amount should be reported in box 12 of your 2016 Form W-2
        with code Q.
        <br><br>
        Compensation for Purposes of an IRA:
        <br><br>
        Includes:
        <li>wages, salaries, etc.</li>
        <li>commissions</li>
        <li> self-employment income</li>
        <li>alimony and separate maintenance</li>
        <li>nontaxable combat pay</li>
        <br>
        Does not include:
        <li> earnings and profits from property such as rental income</li>
        <li> interest and dividend income</li>
        <li>pension or annuity income</li>
        <li>deferred compensation</li>
        <li> income from certain partnerships</li>
        <li>any amounts you exclude from income such as foreign earned income</li>
        <br><br>
        Kinds of traditional IRAs. Your traditional IRA can be an individual retirement account or annuity.
        It can be part of either a simplified employee pension (SEP) or an employer or employee association
        trust account.
        <br><br>
        Individual Retirement Account
        <br>
        <li>Contributions, except for rollover contributions, must be in cash</li>
        <li>Assets in your account cannot be combined with other property, except in a common trust fund or
            common investment fundMoney in your account cannot be used to buy a life insurance policy
        </li>
        <li> You must start receiving distributions by April 1 of the year following the year in which you
            reach age 70½
        </li>
        <br><br>
        General Limit
        For 2016, the most that can be contributed to your traditional IRA generally is the smaller of the
        following amounts:
        <br>
        <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
        <li>Your taxable compensation (defined earlier) for the year.</li>
        <br>
        Note
        <br>
        This is the most that can be contributed regardless of whether the contributions are to one or more
        traditional IRAs or whether all or part of the contributions are nondeductible. (See Nondeductible
        Contributions , later.) Qualified reservist repayments do not affect this limit.
        <br><br>
        Examples.
        <br>
        George, who is 34 years old and single, earns $24,000 in 2016. His IRA contributions for 2016 are
        limited to $5,500.
        <br><br>
        Danny, an unmarried college student working part time, earns $3,500 in 2016. His IRA contributions
        for 2016 are limited to $3,500, the amount of his compensation.
        <br><br>
        More than one IRA. If you have more than one IRA, the limit applies to the total contributions made
        on your behalf to all your traditional IRAs for the year.
        <br><br>
        Annuity or endowment contracts. If you invest in an annuity or endowment contract under an individual
        retirement annuity, no more than $5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older) can be contributed toward
        its cost for the tax year, including the cost of life insurance coverage. If more than this amount is
        contributed, the annuity or endowment contract is disqualified.
        <br><br>
        Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit
        <br>
        For 2016, if you file a joint return and your taxable compensation is less than that of your spouse,
        the most that can be contributed for the year to your IRA is the smaller of the following two amounts:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
            <li>The total compensation includible in the gross income of both you and your spouse for the year,
                reduced by the following two amounts.
            </li>
        </ol>
        a) Your spouse's IRA contribution for the year to a traditional IRA.
        <br>
        b) Any contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of your spouse.
        <br><br>
        This means that the total combined contributions that can be made for the year to your IRA and your spouse's
        IRA can be as much as $11,000 ($12,000 if only one of you is age 50 or older or $13,000 if both of you are
        age 50 or older).
        <br><br>
        Filing Status
        Generally, except as discussed earlier under Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit , your filing
        status has no effect on the amount of allowable contributions to your traditional IRA. However, if during
        the year either you or your spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, your deduction may be
        reduced or eliminated, depending on your filing status and income. See How Much Can You Deduct? , later.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Tom and Darcy are married and both are 53. They both work and each has a traditional IRA. Tom earned
        $3,800 and Darcy earned $48,000 in 2016. Because of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit rule,
        even though Tom earned less than $6,500, they can contribute up to $6,500 to his IRA for 2016 if they
        file a joint return. They can contribute up to $6,500 to Darcy's IRA. If they file separate returns,
        the amount that can be contributed to Tom's IRA is limited by his earned income, $3,800.
        <br><br>
        Less Than Maximum Contributions
        If contributions to your traditional IRA for a year were less than the limit, you cannot contribute
        more after the due date of your return for that year to make up the difference.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Rafael, who is 40, earns $30,000 in 2016. Although he can contribute up to $5,500 for 2016, he
        contributes only $3,000. After April 18, 2017, Rafael cannot make up the difference between his
        actual contributions for 2016 ($3,000) and his 2016 limit ($5,500). He cannot contribute $2,500
        more than the limit for any later year.
        <br><br>
        More Than Maximum Contributions
        <br>
        If contributions to your IRA for a year were more than the limit, you can apply the excess
        contribution in one year to a later year if the contributions for that later year are less
        than the maximum allowed for that year. However, a penalty or additional tax may apply.
        See Excess Contributions , later, under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes?
        <br><br>
        Contributions must be made by due date. Contributions can be made to your traditional IRA for a year
        at any time during the year or by the due date for filing your return for that year, not including
        extensions. For most people, this means that contributions for 2016 must be made by April 18, 2017.
        <br><br>
        Due date for contributions. Because April 15, 2017 falls on a Saturday, and Emancipation Day, a
        legal holiday in the District of Columbia is observed on Monday, April 17, 2017, the due date for
        making contributions for 2016 to your IRA is April 18, 2017, even if you do not live in the District
        of Columbia.
        <br><br>
        Age 70½ rule. Contributions cannot be made to your traditional IRA for the year in which you reach
        age 70½ or for any later year. You attain age 70½ on the date that is 6 calendar months after the
        70th anniversary of your birth. If you were born on or before June 30, 1946, you cannot contribute
        for 2016 or any later year.
        <br><br>
        Designating year for which contribution is made. If an amount is contributed to your traditional
        IRA between January 1 and April 18, you should tell the sponsor which year (the current year or the
        previous year) the contribution is for. If you do not tell the sponsor which year it is for, the
        sponsor can assume, and report to the IRS, that the contribution is for the current year (the year
        the sponsor received it).
        <br><br>
        Filing before a contribution is made. You can file your return claiming a traditional IRA
        contribution before the contribution is actually made. Generally, the contribution must be
        made by the due date of your return, not including extensions.
        <br><br>
        Contributions not required. You do not have to contribute to your traditional IRA for every
        tax year, even if you can.
        <br><br>
        How Much Can You Deduct?
        Generally, you can deduct the lesser of:
        <li>The contributions to your traditional IRA for the year, or</li>
        <li>The general limit (or the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit, if applicable) explained
            earlier under How Much Can Be Contributed? .
        </li>
        <br>
        However, if you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement plan,
        you may not be able to deduct this amount. See Limit if Covered by Employer Plan ,
        <br><br>
        Brokers' commissions. These commissions are part of your IRA contribution and, as such, are deductible
        subject to the limits.
        <br><br>
        Full deduction. If neither you nor your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer
        retirement plan, you can take a deduction for total contributions to one or more of your traditional
        IRAs of up to the lesser of:
        <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
        <li>100% of your compensation</li>
        <br><br>
        Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA. In the case of a married couple with unequal compensation who file
        a joint return, the deduction for contributions to the traditional IRA of the spouse with less
        compensation is limited to the lesser of:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if the spouse with the lower compensation is age 50 or older), or</li>
            <li>The total compensation includible in the gross income of both spouses for the year reduced by
                the following three amounts.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>The IRA deduction for the year of the spouse with the greater compensation.</li>
            <li>Any designated nondeductible contribution for the year made on behalf of the spouse with the
                greater compensation.
            </li>
            <li>Any contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of the spouse with the greater
                compensation.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        This limit is reduced by any contributions to a section 501(c)(18) plan on behalf of the spouse with
        the lesser compensation.
        <br><br>
        Note.
        If you were divorced or legally separated (and did not remarry) before the end of the year, you cannot
        deduct any contributions to your spouse's IRA. After a divorce or legal separation, you can deduct only
        the contributions to your own IRA. Your deductions are subject to the rules for single individuals.
        <br><br>
        Covered by an employer retirement plan. If you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement
        plan at any time during the year for which contributions were made, your deduction may be further limited.
        This is discussed later under Limit if Covered by Employer Plan . Limits on the amount you can deduct do
        not affect the amount that can be contributed.
        <br><br>
        Are You Covered by an Employer Plan?
        <br>
        The Form W-2 you receive from your employer has a box used to indicate whether you were covered for the
        year. The “Retirement Plan” box should be checked if you were covered.
        <br><br>
        Reservists and volunteer firefighters should also see Situations in Which You Are Not Covered , later.
        <br><br>
        If you are not certain whether you were covered by your employer's retirement plan, you should ask your
        employer.
        <br><br>
        Federal judges. For purposes of the IRA deduction, federal judges are covered by an employer plan.
        <br><br>
        For Which Year(s) Are You Covered?
        <br>
        Special rules apply to determine the tax years for which you are covered by an employer plan. These rules
        differ depending on whether the plan is a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan.
        <br><br>
        Tax year. Your tax year is the annual accounting period you use to keep records and report income and
        expenses on your income tax return. For almost all people, the tax year is the calendar year.
        <br><br>
        Defined contribution plan. Generally, you are covered by a defined contribution plan for a tax year
        if amounts are contributed or allocated to your account for the plan year that ends with or within that
        tax year. However, also see Situations in Which You Are Not Covered , later.
        <br><br>
        A defined contribution plan is a plan that provides for a separate account for each person covered by the
        plan. In a defined contribution plan, the amount to be contributed to each participant's account is spelled
        out in the plan. The level of benefits actually provided to a participant depends on the total amount
        contributed to that participant's account and any earnings and losses on those contributions. Types of
        defined contribution plans include profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, and money purchase pension plans.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Company A has a money purchase pension plan. Its plan year is from July 1 to June 30. The plan provides that
        contributions must be allocated as of June 30. Bob, an employee, leaves Company A on December 31, 2015.
        The contribution for the plan year ending on June 30, 2016, is made February 15, 2017. Because an amount
        is contributed to Bob's account for the plan year, Bob is covered by the plan for his 2016 tax year.
        <br><br>
        A special rule applies to certain plans in which it is not possible to determine if an amount will be
        contributed to your account for a given plan year. If, for a plan year, no amounts have been allocated
        to your account that are attributable to employer contributions, employee contributions, or forfeitures,
        by the last day of the plan year, and contributions are discretionary for the plan year, you are not
        covered for the tax year in which the plan year ends. If, after the plan year ends, the employer makes
        a contribution for that plan year, you are covered for the tax year in which the contribution is made.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Mickey was covered by a profit-sharing plan and left the company on December 31, 2015. The plan year runs
        from July 1 to June 30. Under the terms of the plan, employer contributions do not have to be made, but if
        they are made, they are contributed to the plan before the due date for filing the company's tax return.
        Such contributions are allocated as of the last day of the plan year, and allocations are made to the
        accounts of individuals who have any service during the plan year. As of June 30, 2016, no contributions
        were made that were allocated to the June 30, 2016, plan year, and no forfeitures had been allocated
        within the plan year. In addition, as of that date, the company was not obligated to make a contribution
        for such plan year and it was impossible to determine whether or not a contribution would be made for the
        plan year. On December 31, 2016, the company decided to contribute to the plan for the plan year ending
        June 30, 2016. That contribution was made on February 15, 2017. Mickey is an active participant in the
        plan for his 2017 tax year but not for his 2016 tax year.
        <br><br>
        No vested interest. If an amount is allocated to your account for a plan year, you are covered by that
        plan even if you have no vested interest in (legal right to) the account.
        <br><br>
        Defined benefit plan. If you are eligible to participate in your employer's defined benefit plan for the
        plan year that ends within your tax year, you are covered by the plan. This rule applies even if you:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Declined to participate in the plan,</li>
            <li>Did not make a required contribution, or</li>
            <li>Did not perform the minimum service required to accrue a benefit for the year.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        A defined benefit plan is any plan that is not a defined contribution plan. In a defined benefit plan,
        the level of benefits to be provided to each participant is spelled out in the plan. The plan
        administrator figures the amount needed to provide those benefits and those amounts are contributed
        to the plan. Defined benefit plans include pension plans and annuity plans.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Nick, an employee of Company B, is eligible to participate in Company B's defined benefit plan, which has
        a July 1 to June 30 plan year. Nick leaves Company B on December 31, 2015. Because Nick is eligible to
        participate in the plan for its year ending June 30, 2016, he is covered by the plan for his 2016 tax year.
        <br><br>
        No vested interest. If you accrue a benefit for a plan year, you are covered by that plan even if you have no
        vested interest in (legal right to) the accrual.
        <br><br>
        Situations in Which You Are Not Covered
        <br>
        Unless you are covered by another employer plan, you are not covered by an employer plan if you are in one
        of the situations described below.
        <br><br>
        Social security or railroad retirement. Coverage under social security or railroad retirement is not
        coverage under an employer retirement plan.
        <br><br>
        Benefits from previous employer's plan. If you receive retirement benefits from a previous employer's
        plan, you are not covered by that plan.
        <br><br>
        Reservists. If the only reason you participate in a plan is because you are a member of a reserve unit
        of the Armed Forces, you may not be covered by the plan. You are not covered by the plan if both of the
        following conditions are met.
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>The plan you participate in is established for its employees by:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The United States,</li>
                <li>A state or political subdivision of a state, or</li>
                <li> An instrumentality of either (a) or (b) above.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>You did not serve more than 90 days on active duty during the year (not counting duty for
                training).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Volunteer firefighters. If the only reason you participate in a plan is because you are a volunteer
        firefighter, you may not be covered by the plan. You are not covered by the plan if both of the following
        conditions are met.
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>The plan you participate in is established for its employees by:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>The United States,</li>
                <li>A state or political subdivision of a state, or</li>
                <li> An instrumentality of either (a) or (b) above.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <li>Your accrued retirement benefits at the beginning of the year will not provide more than $1,800 per year
                at retirement.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Limit if Covered by Employer Plan
        <br>
        As discussed earlier, the deduction you can take for contributions made to your traditional IRA depends on
        whether you or your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer retirement plan. Your deduction
        is also affected by how much income you had and by your filing status. Your deduction may also be affected
        by social security benefits you received.
        <br><br>
        Reduced or no deduction. If either you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement plan, you may
        be entitled to only a partial (reduced) deduction or no deduction at all, depending on your income and your
        filing status.
        <br><br>
        Your deduction begins to decrease (phase out) when your income rises above a certain amount and is eliminated
        altogether when it reaches a higher amount. These amounts vary depending on your filing status.
        <br><br>
        To determine if your deduction is subject to the phaseout, you must determine your modified adjusted gross
        income (AGI) and your filing status, as explained later under Deduction Phaseout . Once you have determined
        your modified AGI and your filing status, you can use Table 1-2 or Table 1-3 to determine if the phaseout
        applies.
        <br><br>
        Instead of using Table 1-2 or Table 1-3 and Worksheet 1-2, Figuring Your Reduced IRA Deduction for 2016,
        later, complete the worksheets in Appendix B of this publication if, for the year, all of the following apply.
