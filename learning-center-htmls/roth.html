        <li>For 2016, and 2017, your total contributions to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs cannot
            be more than $5,500 ($6,500 if you’re age 50 or older), or your taxable compensation for the
            year, if your compensation was less than this dollar limit.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>The IRA contribution limit does not apply to rollover contributions</li>
        <br>
        <li>Most pre-retirement payments you receive from a retirement plan or IRA can be “rolled over”
            by depositing the payment in another retirement plan or IRA within 60 days. You can also
            have your financial institution or plan directly transfer the payment to another plan or IRA.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>When you roll over a retirement plan distribution, you generally don’t pay tax on it until you
            withdraw it from the new plan. By rolling over, you’re saving for your future and your money
            continues to grow tax-deferred.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If you don’t roll over your payment, it will be taxable (other than qualified Roth distributions
            and any amounts already taxed) and you may also be subject to additional tax unless you’re eligible
            for one of the exceptions to the 10% additional tax on early distributions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5>How to complete a rollover</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Direct rollover – If you’re getting a distribution from a retirement plan, you can ask your plan
                administrator to make the payment directly to another retirement plan or to an IRA. Contact your
                plan administrator for instructions. The administrator may issue your distribution in the form of
                a check made payable to your new account. No taxes will be withheld from your transfer amount.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Trustee-to-trustee transfer – If you’re getting a distribution from an IRA, you can ask the financial
                institution holding your IRA to make the payment directly from your IRA to another IRA or to a
                retirement plan. No taxes will be withheld from your transfer amount.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> 60-day rollover – If a distribution from an IRA or a retirement plan is paid directly to you, you
                can deposit all or a portion of it in an IRA or a retirement plan within 60 days. Taxes will be
                withheld from a distribution from a retirement plan (see below), so you’ll have to use other funds
                to roll over the full amount of the distribution.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h5>IRA one-rollover-per-year rule: </h5>

        <li> You generally cannot make more than one rollover from the same IRA within a 1-year period. You also
            cannot make a rollover during this 1-year period from the IRA to which the distribution was rolled
            over.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Beginning after January 1, 2015, you can make only one rollover from an IRA to another (or the same)
            IRA in any 12-month period, regardless of the number of IRAs you own.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h5>The one-per year limit does not apply to:</h5>

        <li> rollovers from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs (conversions)</li>
        <li> trustee-to-trustee transfers to another IRA</li>
        <li>IRA-to-plan rollovers</li>
        <li>plan-to-IRA rollovers</li>
        <li>plan-to-plan rollovers</li>
