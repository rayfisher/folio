        IRA
        <br>
        A traditional IRA is any IRA that is not a Roth IRA or a SIMPLE IRA. The following are two advantages
        of a traditional IRA:
        <br><br>
        <li>You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to it, depending on your circumstances.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Generally, amounts in your IRA, including earnings and gains, are not taxed until they are
            distributed.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?
        <br>
        You can open and make contributions to a traditional IRA if:
        <br><br>
        <li>You (or, if you file a joint return, your spouse) received taxable compensation during the year,
            and
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>You were not age 70½ by the end of the year.</li>
        <br>
        You can have a traditional IRA whether or not you are covered by any other retirement plan. However,
        you may not be able to deduct all of your contributions if you or your spouse is covered by an employer
        retirement plan. See How Much Can You Deduct? , later.
        <br><br>
        Both spouses have compensation. If both you and your spouse have compensation and are under age 70½,
        each of you can open an IRA. You cannot both participate in the same IRA. If you file a joint return,
        only one of you needs to have compensation.
        <br><br>
        What Is Compensation?
        <br><br>
        Generally, compensation is what you earn from working. For a summary of what compensation does and
        does not include, see Table 1-1. Compensation includes all of the items discussed next (even if you
        have more than one type).
        <br><br>
        Wages, salaries, etc. Wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other amounts you
        receive for providing personal services are compensation. The IRS treats as compensation any amount
        properly shown in box 1 (Wages, tips, other compensation) of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement,
        provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11 (Nonqualified plans).
        Scholarship and fellowship payments are compensation for IRA purposes only if shown in box 1 of Form
        W-2.
        <br><br>
        Commissions. An amount you receive that is a percentage of profits or sales price is compensation.
        <br><br>
        Self-employment income. If you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or a partner), compensation is
        the net earnings from your trade or business (provided your personal services are a material
        income-producing factor) reduced by the total of:
        <br><br>
        <li>The deduction for contributions made on your behalf to retirement plans, and</li>
        <li>The deduction allowed for the deductible part of your self-employment taxes.</li>
        <br><br>
        Self-employment loss. If you have a net loss from self-employment, do not subtract the loss from
        your salaries or wages when figuring your total compensation.
        <br><br>
        Alimony and separate maintenance. For IRA purposes, compensation includes any taxable alimony and
        separate maintenance payments you receive under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.
        <br><br>
        Nontaxable combat pay. If you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, compensation includes any
        nontaxable combat pay you received. This amount should be reported in box 12 of your 2016 Form W-2
        with code Q.
        <br><br>
        Compensation for Purposes of an IRA:
        <br><br>
        Includes:
        <li>wages, salaries, etc.</li>
        <li>commissions</li>
        <li> self-employment income</li>
        <li>alimony and separate maintenance</li>
        <li>nontaxable combat pay</li>
        <br>
        Does not include:
        <li> earnings and profits from property such as rental income</li>
        <li> interest and dividend income</li>
        <li>pension or annuity income</li>
        <li>deferred compensation</li>
        <li> income from certain partnerships</li>
        <li>any amounts you exclude from income such as foreign earned income</li>
        <br><br>
        Kinds of traditional IRAs. Your traditional IRA can be an individual retirement account or annuity.
        It can be part of either a simplified employee pension (SEP) or an employer or employee association
        trust account.
        <br><br>
        Individual Retirement Account
        <br>
        <li>Contributions, except for rollover contributions, must be in cash</li>
        <li>Assets in your account cannot be combined with other property, except in a common trust fund or
            common investment fundMoney in your account cannot be used to buy a life insurance policy
        </li>
        <li> You must start receiving distributions by April 1 of the year following the year in which you
            reach age 70½
        </li>
        <br><br>
        General Limit
        For 2016, the most that can be contributed to your traditional IRA generally is the smaller of the
        following amounts:
        <br>
        <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
        <li>Your taxable compensation (defined earlier) for the year.</li>
        <br>
        Note
        <br>
        This is the most that can be contributed regardless of whether the contributions are to one or more
        traditional IRAs or whether all or part of the contributions are nondeductible. (See Nondeductible
        Contributions , later.) Qualified reservist repayments do not affect this limit.
        <br><br>
        Examples.
        <br>
        George, who is 34 years old and single, earns $24,000 in 2016. His IRA contributions for 2016 are
        limited to $5,500.
        <br><br>
        Danny, an unmarried college student working part time, earns $3,500 in 2016. His IRA contributions
        for 2016 are limited to $3,500, the amount of his compensation.
        <br><br>
        More than one IRA. If you have more than one IRA, the limit applies to the total contributions made
        on your behalf to all your traditional IRAs for the year.
        <br><br>
        Annuity or endowment contracts. If you invest in an annuity or endowment contract under an individual
        retirement annuity, no more than $5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older) can be contributed toward
        its cost for the tax year, including the cost of life insurance coverage. If more than this amount is
        contributed, the annuity or endowment contract is disqualified.
        <br><br>
        Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit
        <br>
        For 2016, if you file a joint return and your taxable compensation is less than that of your spouse,
        the most that can be contributed for the year to your IRA is the smaller of the following two amounts:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
            <li>The total compensation includible in the gross income of both you and your spouse for the year,
                reduced by the following two amounts.
            </li>
        </ol>
        a) Your spouse's IRA contribution for the year to a traditional IRA.
        <br>
        b) Any contributions for the year to a Roth IRA on behalf of your spouse.
        <br><br>
        This means that the total combined contributions that can be made for the year to your IRA and your spouse's
        IRA can be as much as $11,000 ($12,000 if only one of you is age 50 or older or $13,000 if both of you are
        age 50 or older).
        <br><br>
        Filing Status
        Generally, except as discussed earlier under Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit , your filing
        status has no effect on the amount of allowable contributions to your traditional IRA. However, if during
        the year either you or your spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, your deduction may be
        reduced or eliminated, depending on your filing status and income. See How Much Can You Deduct? , later.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Tom and Darcy are married and both are 53. They both work and each has a traditional IRA. Tom earned
        $3,800 and Darcy earned $48,000 in 2016. Because of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit rule,
        even though Tom earned less than $6,500, they can contribute up to $6,500 to his IRA for 2016 if they
        file a joint return. They can contribute up to $6,500 to Darcy's IRA. If they file separate returns,
        the amount that can be contributed to Tom's IRA is limited by his earned income, $3,800.
        <br><br>
        Less Than Maximum Contributions
        If contributions to your traditional IRA for a year were less than the limit, you cannot contribute
        more after the due date of your return for that year to make up the difference.
        <br><br>
        Example.
        <br>
        Rafael, who is 40, earns $30,000 in 2016. Although he can contribute up to $5,500 for 2016, he
        contributes only $3,000. After April 18, 2017, Rafael cannot make up the difference between his
        actual contributions for 2016 ($3,000) and his 2016 limit ($5,500). He cannot contribute $2,500
        more than the limit for any later year.
        <br><br>
        More Than Maximum Contributions
        <br>
        If contributions to your IRA for a year were more than the limit, you can apply the excess
        contribution in one year to a later year if the contributions for that later year are less
        than the maximum allowed for that year. However, a penalty or additional tax may apply.
        See Excess Contributions , later, under What Acts Result in Penalties or Additional Taxes?
        <br><br>
        Contributions must be made by due date. Contributions can be made to your traditional IRA for a year
        at any time during the year or by the due date for filing your return for that year, not including
        extensions. For most people, this means that contributions for 2016 must be made by April 18, 2017.
        <br><br>
        Due date for contributions. Because April 15, 2017 falls on a Saturday, and Emancipation Day, a
        legal holiday in the District of Columbia is observed on Monday, April 17, 2017, the due date for
        making contributions for 2016 to your IRA is April 18, 2017, even if you do not live in the District
        of Columbia.
        <br><br>
        Age 70½ rule. Contributions cannot be made to your traditional IRA for the year in which you reach
        age 70½ or for any later year. You attain age 70½ on the date that is 6 calendar months after the
        70th anniversary of your birth. If you were born on or before June 30, 1946, you cannot contribute
        for 2016 or any later year.
        <br><br>
        Designating year for which contribution is made. If an amount is contributed to your traditional
        IRA between January 1 and April 18, you should tell the sponsor which year (the current year or the
        previous year) the contribution is for. If you do not tell the sponsor which year it is for, the
        sponsor can assume, and report to the IRS, that the contribution is for the current year (the year
        the sponsor received it).
        <br><br>
        Filing before a contribution is made. You can file your return claiming a traditional IRA
        contribution before the contribution is actually made. Generally, the contribution must be
        made by the due date of your return, not including extensions.
        <br><br>
        Contributions not required. You do not have to contribute to your traditional IRA for every
        tax year, even if you can.
        <br><br>
        How Much Can You Deduct?
        Generally, you can deduct the lesser of:
        <li>The contributions to your traditional IRA for the year, or</li>
        <li>The general limit (or the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit, if applicable) explained
            earlier under How Much Can Be Contributed? .
        </li>
        <br>
        However, if you or your spouse was covered by an employer retirement plan,
        you may not be able to deduct this amount. See Limit if Covered by Employer Plan ,
        <br><br>
        Brokers' commissions. These commissions are part of your IRA contribution and, as such, are deductible
        subject to the limits.
        <br><br>
        Full deduction. If neither you nor your spouse was covered for any part of the year by an employer
        retirement plan, you can take a deduction for total contributions to one or more of your traditional
        IRAs of up to the lesser of:
        <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if you are age 50 or older), or</li>
        <li>100% of your compensation</li>
        <br><br>
        Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA. In the case of a married couple with unequal compensation who file
        a joint return, the deduction for contributions to the traditional IRA of the spouse with less
        compensation is limited to the lesser of:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>$5,500 ($6,500 if the spouse with the lower compensation is age 50 or older), or</li>
            <li>The total compensation includible in the gross income of both spouses for the year reduced by
                the following three amounts.
            </li>
        </ol>
