        IRA
        <br>
        A traditional IRA is any IRA that is not a Roth IRA or a SIMPLE IRA. The following are two advantages
        of a traditional IRA:
        <br><br>
        <li>You may be able to deduct some or all of your contributions to it, depending on your circumstances.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Generally, amounts in your IRA, including earnings and gains, are not taxed until they are
            distributed.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        Who Can Open a Traditional IRA?
        <br>
        You can open and make contributions to a traditional IRA if:
        <br><br>
        <li>You (or, if you file a joint return, your spouse) received taxable compensation during the year,
            and
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>You were not age 70½ by the end of the year.</li>
        <br>
        You can have a traditional IRA whether or not you are covered by any other retirement plan. However,
        you may not be able to deduct all of your contributions if you or your spouse is covered by an employer
        retirement plan. See How Much Can You Deduct? , later.
        <br><br>
        Both spouses have compensation. If both you and your spouse have compensation and are under age 70½,
        each of you can open an IRA. You cannot both participate in the same IRA. If you file a joint return,
        only one of you needs to have compensation.
        <br><br>
        What Is Compensation?
        <br><br>
        Generally, compensation is what you earn from working. For a summary of what compensation does and
        does not include, see Table 1-1. Compensation includes all of the items discussed next (even if you
        have more than one type).
        <br><br>
        Wages, salaries, etc. Wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other amounts you
        receive for providing personal services are compensation. The IRS treats as compensation any amount
        properly shown in box 1 (Wages, tips, other compensation) of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement,
        provided that amount is reduced by any amount properly shown in box 11 (Nonqualified plans).
        Scholarship and fellowship payments are compensation for IRA purposes only if shown in box 1 of Form
        W-2.
        <br><br>
        Commissions. An amount you receive that is a percentage of profits or sales price is compensation.
        <br><br>
        Self-employment income. If you are self-employed (a sole proprietor or a partner), compensation is
        the net earnings from your trade or business (provided your personal services are a material
        income-producing factor) reduced by the total of:
        <br><br>
        <li>The deduction for contributions made on your behalf to retirement plans, and</li>
        <li>The deduction allowed for the deductible part of your self-employment taxes.</li>
        <br><br>
        Self-employment loss. If you have a net loss from self-employment, do not subtract the loss from
        your salaries or wages when figuring your total compensation.
        <br><br>
        Alimony and separate maintenance. For IRA purposes, compensation includes any taxable alimony and
        separate maintenance payments you receive under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.
        <br><br>
        Nontaxable combat pay. If you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, compensation includes any
        nontaxable combat pay you received. This amount should be reported in box 12 of your 2016 Form W-2
        with code Q.
        <br><br>
        Compensation for Purposes of an IRA:
        <br><br>
        Includes:
        <li>wages, salaries, etc.</li>
        <li>commissions</li>
        <li> self-employment income</li>
        <li>alimony and separate maintenance</li>
        <li>nontaxable combat pay</li>
        <br>
        Does not include:
        <li> earnings and profits from property such as rental income</li>
        <li> interest and dividend income</li>
        <li>pension or annuity income</li>
        <li>deferred compensation</li>
        <li> income from certain partnerships</li>
        <li>any amounts you exclude from income such as foreign earned income</li>
        <br><br>
